## Changelog

### 0.4.1

* Bugfix(#30): `tolist` wasn't popping elements of the list from stack.

### 0.4.0

* `pushstring` and `tostring` now uses `ByteString` instead of `[Char]`.
* `StackValue [Char]` instance is removed, `StackValue ByteString` is added.
* `StackValue a => StackValue [a]` instance is added. It pushes a Lua array to
  the stack. `pushlist`, `islist` and `tolist` functions are added.
* Type errors in Haskell functions now propagated differently. See the
  `Scripting.Lua` documentation for detailed explanation. This should fix
  segfaults reported several times.
* `lua_error` function is removed, it's never safe to call in Haskell.

### 0.3.14

* Pkgconf-based setup removed. Cabal is now using `extra-libraries` to link with Lua.
* `luajit` flag is added to link hslua with LuaJIT.

### 0.3.13

* Small bugfix related with GHCi running under Windows.

### 0.3.12

* `pushrawhsfunction` and `registerrawhsfunction` functions are added.
* `apicheck` flag is added to Cabal package to enable Lua API checking. (useful for debugging)

### 0.3.11

* `luaL_ref` and `luaL_unref` functions are added.
